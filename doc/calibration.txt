Extraction Rules Generation Flow for OpenRCX

This flow generates the RC tech file for OpenRCX.
The flow involves:
  A. Running OpenRCX to generate patterns layout.
    - Input: tech LEF
    - Output: patterns.def, patterns.v
    - Script: generate_patterns.tcl

  B. Running commercial extractor to extract parasitics of the patterns layout.
    - Input: patterns.def, patterns.v (if required), and additional files
             required by the commercial extractor.
    - Output: patterns.spef
    - Script: Not provided

  C. Running OpenRCX to convert patterns.spef to RC tch file.
    - Input: patterns.spef
    - Output: RC tech file
    - Script: generate_rules.tcl

  D. Benchmarking - test the accuracy of OpenRCX on the patterns layout.
    - Input: patterns.def and RC tech file
    - Output: rcx.spef, diff_spef.out
    - Script: ext_patterns.tcl

How to run:
  1. Go to OpenRCX home directory (./OpenROAD/src/OpenRCX).
  2. cd calibration.
  3. Modify the user_env.tcl scipt in the script directory.
    - TECH_LEF: points to the directory of the tech LEF
    - PROCESS_NODE: the technology node
    - extRules: the name and the location of the OpenRCX tech file
  4. Run the executable script run.sh --> run step A through D.
    - source run.sh or
    - ./run.sh
  5. The OpenRCX RC tech file can be found in the directory set
     in the extRules variable.
